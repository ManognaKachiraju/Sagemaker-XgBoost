Sagemaker XGBoost Implementation
This project demonstrates the implementation of XGBoost using Amazon SageMaker. It includes steps for creating an S3 bucket, uploading data, and mapping model paths.

Steps to Follow
1. Importing Necessary Libraries
Make sure to import the required libraries for AWS S3 operations and SageMaker functionalities. For example:

python

import boto3
import sagemaker
from sagemaker import get_execution_role
2. Creating an S3 Bucket
Create an S3 bucket to store your training and testing data. This can be done using the AWS Management Console or via the AWS SDK:

python
Copy code
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'
s3.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
3. Mapping Train and Test Data in S3
Upload your training and test datasets to the S3 bucket. Ensure the paths are correctly mapped:

python

train_data = 's3://your-bucket-name/train-data/'
test_data = 's3://your-bucket-name/test-data/'
4. Mapping the Path of the Models in S3
Specify the S3 path where your models will be stored after training:

python

model_output_path = 's3://your-bucket-name/model-output/'
Usage
Set Up AWS Credentials: Ensure your AWS credentials are configured properly. You can set this up via the AWS CLI or environment variables.

Run the Script: Execute the provided script to start the training process. The script will use the specified S3 paths for data and model storage.

Monitor Training: Check the SageMaker console for the training job status and logs.
